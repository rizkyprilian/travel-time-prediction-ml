                    Billions of amounts of money are lost in the road traffic worldwide every day. In logistic world, being able to predict travel time would enable drivers and fleet managers to plan route, promised delivery time, resource which could potentially reduce the amounts of hours lost in traffic and generating more delivery volume.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In simple mathematical way, time spent on the road depends on the distance travelled and average speed. However due to the complexity of the road conditions such as traffic congestion, busy intersections, bridges, tunnels, type of roads (highway, motorway, city-lane) might affect the overall time required to finish a trip. Tracking all these factors manually would become very hard. Luckily, the rise of affordable consumer grade GPS receiver allows companies to track their vehicle online. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, I’d like to experiment to use historical gps data trajectory recorded from gps receiver installed in vehicles and combined it with external map data, then we can try to use machine learning algorithm to predict trip duration

                <p>Transport operators, delivery companies, supply chain managers are facing increasingly complex challenge to deliver in urban areas. Due to the rise of urban population and large amount of mobility, traffic congestion surged and has been causing significant delay in shipping time </p>
                <p>While being under pressure to deliver a large volume of cargo everyday, transport operators also needs to always consider time factor. In 2016, World Bank released Logistic Performance Index report, and in that report it was stated that <b>predictability</b> is the main factor in keeping the performance index high.</p>
                <p><b>There are few common strategy in tackling efficiency issue:</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>- Adapting vehicle size (Try to avoid unused capacity and road restriction)</li>
                    <li>- Transshipment to smaller vehicles</li>
                    <li>- Collaboration with public sector</li>
                </ol>
                <p> <b>Furthermore, in terms of delivery efficiency, there are several factor to consider:</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>- Time</li>
                    <li>- Speed</li>
                    <li>- Distance</li>
                    <li>- Capacity</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Those factors above involving observation of time based data (Temporal) and spatial data. Thus, it often leads to study of GeoSpatial aspect of the business.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-1">Utilization Measures</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>- Loading</li>
                    <li>- Vehicle Time</li>

                <h3 class="mt-1">Internal Transport Efficiency Measures</h3>
                <p>Apart from the external factors mentioned above, Transport operators also need to adjust and optimize internal aspect of their business process</p>
                <h4>1. Driver Efficiency</h4>
                <p>Maintaining high standard operational procedure leads to better safety score and eco-driving training.</p>
                <h4>2. Vehicle Efficiency</h4>
                <p>Increasing load factor and decreasing the number of empty kilometres.</p>

                <p>In this study, I'd like to conduct studying which factors contributes to travel time over distance of journey. There are two main audiences:</p>

                <h4 class="mt-2">1. Business Owner and Fleet Managers</h4>
                <p>An accurate ETA will boost the efficiency of the transportation system, reducing travel cost for the users, saving energy consumption and reducing motor vehicle pollution. Therefore, ETA has become a core component that influences decision-making</p>
                <p>Other common question that could be addressed are:</p>
                <p>- When is the most efficient time to deliver a package from point A to point B?</p>
                <p>- Which route is most efficient but does not hurt SLA promise?</p>
                <p>- Company need to know when each vehicles arrive at destination, so they can be scheduled for another trip (with load)</p>
                <p>- Managing and analyzing tons of historical data is hard, company needs automation</p>

                <h4 class="mt-2">2. Product Owner</h4>
                <p>GPS receiver hardware keeps getting more affordable nowadays due to mass production by following market demands. However track and trace only feature might not be sufficient to target market (especially from B2B sector). Hiring talents to keep analyzing the tracking data manually are both time and cost inefficient.</p>
                <p>Therefore, the system or software need to offer prediction feature as well to help customers make critical decision in points of times. </p>

                    GPS (Global Positioning System) is the satellite navigation system that provides location and time data in all weather conditions by way of four or more satellites for the aim of detecting position of the GPS receiver in any accessible line of vision around the globe.

                <p>
                    With its simplest definition, a vehicle tracking system is the system that allows tracking and controlling of vehicles via an online computer, smart phone, tablet, etc. on a 7/24 basis thanks to GPS satellites. Vehicle tracking systems make it possible to have an instantaneous and history tracking of vehicle speeds, the routes they followed, on maps providing a registry and check point with past and present reports.

                    The result is still considered as underfit to be implemented in production. There are more iteration work needed with below recommendation:
                </p>
                <p>- Reduce round trip sample, customer premise should be tagged or we can use clustering the raw trajectory (although it will took long time)</p>
                <p>- Increase trip sampling for at least a year to see any correlation with time of the year (public holiday, important event)</p>
                <p>- Add more trip features that can be inverred from historical gps data (lane count, congestion, pavement type)</p>
                <p>- Apply model to each segment of the road. </p>
